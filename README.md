## More glue

Grunt plugins area amazing, but sometimes you need to do some glue to make than achieve your desired result. One example is only liting css and js files that are not generated by preprocessors. Don't be afraid, Grunt has many functions that can help you to create your outstanding Gruntfile.js.

## How to run

Grunt tasks baby! They are:

 `grunt dist`: create a 'dist' folder with all files processed ready for distribution, leaving original files intact. The 'dist' will only be created if there aren't any liting in your JS and CSS files and you have at least 80% of your JavaScript code covered by tests.

 `grunt server`: start a live reloading server, using express, then automatically open your default browser. The server is smart enough to see when you change a file and take an apropriate action.

 `grunt server-all`: the same as 'grunt server', but open all your available browsers at once.
